	<h1>I live in science, but I breathe art.</h1>
	<p>I remember all my friends from school having heroic answers to the big question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?”. Soccer players, firefighters or astronauts were the popular choices. As for me, I made my mind when I was around 8 years old: I wanted to be a computers engineer. My first computer had brought me to the breathtaking world of technology, which has been amazing me ever since.</p>

<p>My other great passion started to grow slowly as I explored my dad’s records and later started to perform in front of my family, singing my own words on top of pre-recorded songs coming from a children’s keyboard. Playing music eventually became a significant part of my life and the creative process of making songs is one of the things that fulfills me the most.</p>

<p>This everlasting battle between left brain and right brain led me to pursue a career as a programmer, creating a bridge between my two worlds and allowing me to focus on what I am truly meant to do: imagining things and bringing them to life.</p>

<p>I love numbers, but I adore words. My brain thinks code, but my eyes scream aesthetics. I live in science, but I breathe art.</p>
