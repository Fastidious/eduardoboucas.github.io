  text: "At Monocle I was responsible for maintaining the website, implementing new features, working on the integration between the website and M24 — Monocle's online radio station — as well as designing and building a series of internal tools. Front-end typically involves HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (with jQuery and Ajax always around) whilst the back-end part is mainly PHP, XSLT, MySQL, MongoDB and the constant integration with the CMS."

  text: "Monocle's Style Directory is a collection of the sharpest products to buy, people to follow and cities to visit. This build was a great challenge, as the bold design breaks the limits of the typical layout of a website and attemps to provide the look and feel of a magazine. It is a fully responsive website."

  text: "Recording Cloud is a web-based collaborative audio recording platform for musicians. Sort of Pro Tools, DropBox and GitHub put together. Having started as my MSc project dissertation, it makes use of cutting-edge web technologies, such as HTML5 and JavaScript libraries like the Stream API and the Web Audio API. Since I believe it has the potential to have a life of its own out of the academic context, I've been investing a lot of my free time in improving this platform, hoping to make it a reality that helps to foster the exchange between musicians from all over the world."
