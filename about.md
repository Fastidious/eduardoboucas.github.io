Born in the north of Portugal at a very young age, I'm a software engineer with camp set up in London, England. I am a firm supporter of an open, free and independent world-wide web, and an advocate of open source software. I work for [DADI+](https://dadi.co), making all-round awesome things with a strong focus on API-first back-end and front-end systems, and the principle of [COPE](https://github.com/dadi/api/blob/docs/docs/apiFirst.md).

You can find me on places like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas), [GitHub](https://github.com/eduardoboucas) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/eduardoboucas).
