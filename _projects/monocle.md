At Monocle I was responsible for maintaining the website, implementing new features, working on the integration between the website and M24 — Monocle's online radio station — as well as designing and building a series of internal tools. Front-end typically involves HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (with jQuery and Ajax always around) whilst the back-end part is mainly PHP, XSLT, MySQL, MongoDB and the constant integration with the CMS.
