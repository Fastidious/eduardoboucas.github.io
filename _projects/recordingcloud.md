Recording Cloud is a web-based collaborative audio recording platform for musicians. Sort of Pro Tools, DropBox and GitHub put together. Having started as my MSc project dissertation, it makes use of cutting-edge web technologies, such as HTML5 and JavaScript libraries like the Stream API and the Web Audio API. Since I believe it has the potential to have a life of its own out of the academic context, I've been investing a lot of my free time in improving this platform, hoping to make it a reality that helps to foster the exchange between musicians from all over the world.
