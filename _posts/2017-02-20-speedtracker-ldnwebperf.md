Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to talk about [SpeedTracker](https://speedtracker.org) at London Web Performance, a monthly meetup with web performance professionals and enthusiasts. It was great chance to spread the word about the project and share ideas with fellow developers. Hopefully, even recruit some open-source lovers to help me with this endeavour!<!--more-->

A big shout out to [Perry](https://twitter.com/perrydyball) for organising the event, to [Simon](https://twitter.com/simonhearne) for his [amazing talk](https://ldnwebperf.org/sessions/optimising-for-25000-unique-devices/) and to everyone who attended. I'll leave you with the video and slides of my talk.<!--tomb-->
